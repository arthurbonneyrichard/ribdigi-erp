Start by reading `README.md`, then `docs/CHANGE_IMPACT_MVP_UPDATE_2026-08-13.md` (latest product-update audit), then `docs/BUSINESS_REQUIREMENTS_DOCUMENT.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENTS.md`, `docs/DATABASE_DOCUMENTATION.md`, `docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md`, `docs/SECURITY_GUIDE.md`, and `docs/DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`.

Do **not** restart the project. Preserve working engines. Stage 182 froze Tenant MVP User↔Store Membership Remaining-Gate Index Fidelity (ADR-371) — membership remaining-gate hub, blocker matrix, ADR-005/E2E users-RBAC/deferred ADR pointers, explicit membership non-claim. Membership Complete / users.store_id API remain MISSING. Next recommended distinct outline: Tenant MVP hard-delete remaining-gate index fidelity (ADR-003 / hard-delete blockers — hard_delete_claimed false — explicit non-claim) — Stage 183+. Do not claim membership Complete. Do not weaken tenant isolation, RBAC, audit logging, or financial double-entry requirements. Do not fabricate MRR/billing Completes (ADR-002).


## COMMERCIAL PRODUCT / NO-DEMO RULE

RIBDIGI ERP is being developed as a market product, not a demo. Do not introduce or preserve demo tenants, fake production data, prefilled passwords, mocked success responses, placeholder business logic, or UI that pretends an unfinished feature works. Local development fixtures are allowed only when explicitly marked local/test-only and technically blocked from production.

Before declaring any module complete, compare it against `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md` and the authoritative `/docs` acceptance criteria. Report gaps as COMPLETE / PARTIAL / MISSING / BROKEN. Never change a status to COMPLETE merely because a page or endpoint exists.

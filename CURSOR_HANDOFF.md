Start by reading `README.md`, then `docs/CHANGE_IMPACT_MVP_UPDATE_2026-08-13.md` (latest product-update audit), then `docs/BUSINESS_REQUIREMENTS_DOCUMENT.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENTS.md`, `docs/DATABASE_DOCUMENTATION.md`, `docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md`, `docs/SECURITY_GUIDE.md`, and `docs/DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`.

Do **not** restart the project. Preserve working engines. Stage 181 froze Tenant MVP Billing Remaining-Gate Index Fidelity (ADR-369) — billing remaining-gate hub, blocker matrix, ADR-002/deferred honesty/commercial billing pointers, explicit billing non-claim. Billing Complete / payment provider / checkout / fabricated MRR remain MISSING. Next recommended distinct outline: Tenant MVP user↔store membership remaining-gate index fidelity (ADR-005 / membership blockers — user_store_membership_claimed false — explicit non-claim) — Stage 182+. Do not claim billing Complete. Do not weaken tenant isolation, RBAC, audit logging, or financial double-entry requirements. Do not fabricate MRR/billing Completes (ADR-002).


## COMMERCIAL PRODUCT / NO-DEMO RULE

RIBDIGI ERP is being developed as a market product, not a demo. Do not introduce or preserve demo tenants, fake production data, prefilled passwords, mocked success responses, placeholder business logic, or UI that pretends an unfinished feature works. Local development fixtures are allowed only when explicitly marked local/test-only and technically blocked from production.

Before declaring any module complete, compare it against `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md` and the authoritative `/docs` acceptance criteria. Report gaps as COMPLETE / PARTIAL / MISSING / BROKEN. Never change a status to COMPLETE merely because a page or endpoint exists.
